Interface Design - Designing an accessible and responsive design website using only HTML and CSS

Using GitHub for Updates to Project 2 - This is why there is a ReadMe file

Website is based on the recent 2025 L.A. Fires that occurred in the Palisades and Eaton communities. The website focuses on responsive design to Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile views. Media queries were used to create this responsive design. Accessible factors include high contrast between backgrounds and text, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML markup.

Design was first drafted as a mobile-first design method working my way through mobile design then up to tablet and desktop. I used Figma to create the design first and then based my code to match. Figma file is in this repository as well.
